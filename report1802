Today I learned about database data normalization — how removing redundancy helps improve data integrity and makes storing it more efficient. 
I also learned about basic PostgreSQL operations: extracting data from tables, filtering, aggregating, and presenting it.

I encountered some difficulties in working with transactions — it is not yet completely clear how their different types affect data integrity. 
I also have questions about aggregate functions and groupings, especially in complex queries. 
I need to better understand how to optimize SQL queries so that they work faster with large volumes of data. 

Tomorrow I plan to delve deeper into working with transactions and practice writing complex queries.
