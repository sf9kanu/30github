Report on GitHub Commit Issue

I attempted to commit my project to GitHub but couldn’t find a proper way to do it. 

Instead, I uploaded the files manually, which doesn’t count as actual commits. 

Moving forward, I plan to write and commit my code using a different IDE to ensure proper version control.
