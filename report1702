Today, I made important progress in setting up and configuring the environment for working with SAP:

✅ Familiarized myself with the installation guide.
✅ Set up PostgreSQL, choosing version 14 (or an alternative if using a different OS).
✅ Created a superuser password and left the default port 5432.
✅ Installed DBeaver and configured the connection to the database.
✅ Imported and ran SQL scripts to populate the database.
